		<h2>Code of conduct</h2>

		<p>The aim of this workshop is to provide a conference experience that is free from harassment for all attendees, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate any form of harassment towards workshop participants, and sexual language and imagery are not acceptable in any workshop venue, including talks. Any participants found to be violating these rules may be subject to sanctions or expulsion from the workshop at the discretion of the workshop organizers.</p>

		<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors: making offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion; displaying sexual images in public spaces; engaging in deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; engaging in harassing photography or recording; causing sustained disruption of talks or other events; engaging in inappropriate physical contact; giving unwelcome sexual attention; and advocating for, or encouraging, any of the aforementioned behaviors. Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers have the right to take any necessary actions to maintain a welcoming environment for all participants, including warning the offender or expelling them from the workshop.</p>

		<p>Workshop organizers may take action to address any behavior that is intended to disrupt the event or create a hostile environment for any participants. We expect all attendees to adhere to these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.</p>

		<p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other violations of our code of conduct detract from the value of our event for everyone, and we want all attendees to feel happy and comfortable during our workshop. You can make a personal report by contacting any of the organizers.</p>

		<p>When taking a personal report, we will ensure that you are safe and cannot be overheard. This may involve enlisting other event staff to ensure that your report is handled properly. Once you are in a safe place, we will ask you to tell us about what happened. This may be upsetting, but we will handle the situation as respectfully as possible, and you are welcome to bring someone to support you. You will not be asked to confront anyone, and we will not reveal your identity to anyone.</p>

		<p>Our team is dedicated to making sure that you feel safe throughout the event, and we appreciate your attendance.</p>
